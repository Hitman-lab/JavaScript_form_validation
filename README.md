# JavaScript FormValidation

https://hitman-lab.github.io



* In this example we have used javascript to validate the basic html form  <br>
* form field accepts both 'text' and 'numbers' as well <br>
* If the form field accepts numbers then we cannot enter text into this field, same as with text field too. <br>
* If any filed left for entry it will show an error message and fill that box with red color. <br>
* Once we focus back to the filed it will go back to the normal mode. <br>
* email-id also have regular expression validation script.
